# BasicWeather

A very basic weather app. It's my first mobile app development project, so it's extremely rough around the edges. However, I hope to refine it to a point that it becomes my person go-to weather app.


## Notes

- This should only work in the U.S. due to it relying on the National Weather Service's (NOAA's) API.
- **Don't expect iOS to work**! I write code for this on Windows/Linux systems, so I have no ability to test for iOS compatability.
- Don't expect this to ever be published on a storefront such as the Google Play Store or F-Droid. If you want to use this app, be prepared to build it yourself as it updates. Termux may be a good solution to this!
